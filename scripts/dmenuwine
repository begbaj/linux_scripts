# this script asumes that you have a list of executable files
# in the ~/.local/share/wineprefixes/links/ directory, which
# is a directory I created for my own purposes. It is useful
# to better organize .desktop files generated by wine installations
# since I don't want them on any of the home directories (they're ugly)
# those executables are generated by another script I wrote that extracts
# the Exec value from the .desktop file and places it into a dedicated .sh
# script. It may sound bloated, but xdg-open was not working properly
# so instead of fixing that I prefered to just not use .desktop files :)
